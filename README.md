# Real-Time ETL Streaming Pipeline Using Apache Beam and Google Dataflow

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time streaming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using **Apache Beam**, **Google Cloud Dataflow**, **Google Pub/Sub**, and **BigQuery**. The pipeline ingests streaming data from an external API, processes the data in real-time, and stores the aggregated results in BigQuery for further analysis. The ETL process is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the design and implementation of a scalable data pipeline capable of processing high-throughput real-time data, with a focus on windowed aggregations and cloud-native architectures.
